# Overview
This mod adds the stalinium ore, an ore incredibly powerful, overshadowing netherite.

Spawns only below Y = -55. It is found in Stalinite Veins, hidden behind Compressed Bedrock. It requires a Netherite Pickaxe to mine. You gain 1-2 nuggets per Stalinium Vein.

Stalinium cannot be smelted traditionally. It must be compressed in a new machine: 
The Stalinium Press, which uses Redstone Blocks as fuel, and takes 30 real-time seconds per ingot. You need 9 Stalinium nuggets to create one stalinium ingot.
